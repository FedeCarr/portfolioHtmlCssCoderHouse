              <p class="article__text">
                At the beginning of February I emigrated to Barcelona escaping from the monotony that I was living in my city. Sometimes you have to get lost to find yourself and that happened. I arrived in Barcelona at the end of February 2020, after a few weeks the covid quarantine began and my plans were decimated. I clung to my intuition and didn't go back. 
              </p>
              <p class="article__text">
                The situation made me change my plans and I left Barcelona to start volunteering in different parts of Europe. The first in Sicily, then in the south of England and finally in Germany, more precisely in Brandenburg. 
              </p>
              <p class="article__text">
                Honestly, the experiences of these volunteers were not good, except for the last one in Germany. Here I found peace. An amazing group of volunteers and a wonderful place. A place with a lot of history and tranquility. I found my home here after a long time.
              </p>
              <p class="article__text">
                All of my work is a lasdcape-portrait. In my work, I combine the sky, plants, trees and antic buildings, constantly exploring the balanced state of peaceful on nature. In terms of visual presentation, I'm keen to create quiet images with a mixture between nature and the silence of the land.

            <p class="article__text">
              I currently live in Berlin, a city that welcomed me after a series of misfortunes since my arrival in Europe two and a half years ago. This city has two facets, one in the Autumn-Winter season and the other in the Spring-Summer season. The first is characterized by being a city that looks cold and discouraged. Which is a bit like that since in winter the sun does not appear and this affects people's mood. Then in the second season the city becomes warm and green. People in the parks, bars and clubs. The spirit that is breathed in the city is incredible. That is why I always propose to come to Berlin at this time. Berlin falls in love.

            <p class="article__text">
              Minimalism for me represents simplicity and gratitude. The simplicity represented by the little we need to be happy and how complex it is sold to us. It is about what we have and not so much about what we want to have. Therefore, it is related to gratitude. Be grateful for the now, for what we are living. From our friends, from a cloudy sky or simply from the sensation of a deep breath. Sometimes we forget to live and enter a race to nothing. Therefore, I feel that it is important to practice gratitude in the simple things in life. Don't forget to live.

            <p class="article__text">
              Mixed feelings. A little city that I love and miss. The warmth of the people, the food and its cultural movement. Rosario makes me feel less about several things. Especially the atmosphere of friendship between people. Exile makes you value certain things that you don't see in northern countries. Calling a friend to have a beer spontaneously is something totally unthinkable. Everything is structured, there is no uncertainty. Sometimes being uprooted is a feeling that hurts but makes you stronger.
